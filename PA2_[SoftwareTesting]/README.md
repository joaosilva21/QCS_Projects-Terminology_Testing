## Description:
The goal of this project is to develop a software test plan and perform the testing campaign for a software code selected by us. So, we applied some White-Box and Black-Box techniques.

## To run this project:
In this project we just run the code choosed to test it.
Buuuuut, to run the tool of CFG (Control Flow Graph) use the following command:
 ```shellscript
  [your-disk]:[name-path]> python test.py [your_code_in_python]
 ```

## Notes important to read
- The code tested is from one of my old repositories: https://github.com/joaosilva21/TI_Project-Compression_Of_Files/tree/main/2nd_version-2020_%5Btext_compression%5D/src/deflate
- It's important to note that the Data Flow Testing is not really complete. For that, would be necessary to write du-paths and do more tests
- The folder "tests" contains some of the tests used in this project
